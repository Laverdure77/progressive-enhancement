    <h3>The Story</h3>

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
      are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
      The farmer said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the horse came
      back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came
      back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
      have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
      riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh
      dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span> ,” and the farmer responded,
      “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the conscription officers came
      around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
      because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
      “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “ <strong>Maybe</strong> .”
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
      complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
      happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
      <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the
      consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
      consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="good">Good</span> and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas
      are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not
      <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out
      of it...
